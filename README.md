# Project Structure

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This document explains the folder structure of the project. It's organized to keep things clean, modular, and easy to work with. Whether you're new to the project or just need a refresher, this guide will help you navigate the codebase.

---

## **Folder Overview**

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main folders and what they do:

### **`src/`**

This is where all the source code lives. Itâ€™s divided into layers to keep things organized and maintainable.

#### **`domain/`**

This folder contains the core business logic and entities. Think of it as the heart of the application.

- **`entities/`**: Business objects like `User`, `Product`, etc.
- **`repositories/`**: Interfaces for data access (e.g., `UserRepository`). These define how data should be accessed, but not the actual implementation.

#### **`application/`**

This is where the application-specific logic lives. It connects the domain layer with the outer layers.

- **`use-cases/`**: Business logic for specific actions (e.g., `CreateUser`, `GetUser`).
- **`services/`**: Shared services like `AuthService` or `EmailService`.

#### **`interfaces/`**

This layer adapts data between the inner layers (domain and application) and the outer world (HTTP requests, databases, etc.).

- **`controllers/`**: Express.js controllers that handle HTTP requests.
- **`presenters/`**: Formats data for responses (e.g., shaping API responses).
- **`gateways/`**: Adapters for external services (e.g., payment gateways).
- **`middleware/`**: Custom middleware for things like authentication, validation, and error handling.

#### **`infrastructure/`**

This is where the "plumbing" of the application livesâ€”things like databases, web frameworks, and utilities.

- **`database/`**: Database configurations and implementations.
- **`web/`**: Express.js setup (e.g., `app.js`, routes).
- **`third-party/`**: Integrations with external APIs or services.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions (e.g., logging, validation helpers).

#### **`config/`**

Configuration files for environment variables, database connections, etc.

### **`tests/`**

This folder contains all the tests for the application. Itâ€™s split into two subfolders:

- **`unit/`**: Unit tests for individual components (e.g., use cases, services).
- **`integration/`**: Integration tests for things like API endpoints or database interactions.

## **How It All Fits Together**

1. **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic and entities.
2. **Application Layer**: Implements use cases and services that use the domain layer.
3. **Interface Adapters Layer**: Connects the application to the outside world (e.g., HTTP requests, databases).
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles the technical details (e.g., databases, utilities).

This structure keeps the code modular, testable, and easy to maintain. If you need to change something, youâ€™ll know exactly where to look!

## **Example Workflow**

Letâ€™s say you want to add a new feature, like creating a user:

1. **Domain Layer**: Define the `User` entity and the `UserRepository` interface.
2. **Application Layer**: Create a `CreateUser` use case that uses the `UserRepository`.
3. **Interface Adapters Layer**: Add a `UserController` to handle HTTP requests and a `authMiddleware` to protect the route.
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implement the `UserRepository` with your database of choice.

## **Running the Project**

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
